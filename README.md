# Dad-Jokes

Dad-Jokes is a React web application that fetches jokes from the Dad Jokes API and provides a fun way to enjoy and interact with dad jokes.

## Features

- Fetches jokes from the Dad Jokes API.
- Allows users to upvote and downvote jokes.
- Persists jokes and votes using `localStorage`, ensuring they remain even after refreshing the page.
- Sorts jokes based on the number of votes, displaying the most popular ones at the top.

## How it Works

1. **Fetching Jokes**:
   - The application retrieves jokes from the Dad Jokes API.

2. **Storing Jokes and Votes**:
   - Jokes and user votes are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
   - This enables the application to retain the jokes and their respective votes even after a page refresh.

3. **Interacting with Jokes**:
   - Users can upvote or downvote jokes, influencing their sorting order.
   - Jokes are displayed based on the number of votes, with the most popular jokes appearing first.
